# messageforwhentouched
This repository is a basic script that makes the server send a message that someone finished the game. No-one needs to know who it is who completed the game as it is not
timed and it's you who is playing for yourself, not that person playing for you. This is a basic game, hence the message, but who cares? I didn't have time to do the game
as I wanted it to be.
It's currently 12am as I am writing this, and I am pretty sure I have an assessment in school today. (I say today cos the clock says 16/12) So goodnight https://web.roblox.com/games/7700692128/Noob-Parkour-Obby here's the game I took it out of.
